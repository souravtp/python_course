"""
OOP works with objects and classes.
Object is any entity that has attributes and behaviours. For example, a parrot is an object. It has,
attributes - name2, age, color, etc.
behaviour - dancing, singing, etc.

Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.

The main concepts of OOPs are
1. Class:         A collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods.
2. Object:        an object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior.
3. Encapsulation: Wrapping of a data and the code that operates on the data within a single entity. It is also known as
                  information hiding. This allows us to hide the complexity of our code and protect the data
                  from outside access.
4. Inheritance:   Inheriting the properties of a parent class to child class.
5. Polymorphism:  Polymorphism means "many forms", The word polymorphism means having many forms.
                  In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures)
                  being used for different types. The key difference is the data types and number of arguments
                  used in function. and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by
                  inheritance. Polymorphism is a concept of using the same interface to represent different types
                   of objects(for example, we use len() function to find the length of a string, also
                  length of list, tuple, dictionary etc. each time different datatypes are used but len() function
                  works with it). It allows us to write code that can work with objects of different classes.
5. Abstraction:   Data hiding. eg: In an ATM we only need to get money. All the background processes are
                  hidden from us.
                  Abstraction is a concept of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller,
                  more manageable parts. It involves identifying the essential features of a system and ignoring
                  the rest. This allows us to focus on the important details and ignore the irrelevant ones.

Constructor
-----------
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a constructor is a special method that is automatically called
when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the instance variables or attributes
of the object.
In Python, the constructor method is called __init__(). When a new instance of a class is created,
Python automatically calls the __init__() method for that class,
passing in the new object as the first parameter (self). there are two types of constructors. Default constructor and
parameterized constructor.
"""

"""default constructor: The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesâ€™t accept any arguments.
Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed. eg:"""

    # default constructor

The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed

"""
Attributes and methods
----------------------
An attribute is a variable that holds a value. It represents a characteristic of an object,
and it is used to store data. Examples of attributes in a Car class could be make, model, and year.

A method, on the other hand, is a function that performs an action.
It is used to perform some operation on an object or to retrieve data from an object.
Examples of methods in a Car class could be start_engine(), accelerate(), and brake().

"""In this example, __init__() takes three arguments (make, model, and year) along with self,
and assigns them to instance variables (self.make, self.model, and self.year) in the new object.

Python automatically calls __init__() with the my_car object as self and the provided arguments."""
